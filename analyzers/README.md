# Block Analyzers

These are blocks for creating new analyzers using the [NLP++ VSCode language extension](http://vscode.visualtext.org).

## Rules for Block Analyzers

These are the rules for submitting block analyzers:

1. The folder name should be a two to three word descriptive name for the analyzer
2. The first line in the readme should be the same title with a "#" sign header
3. The next line that contains text should be a short description of the analyzer that will appear in the NLP++ VSCode Extension
4. The rest of the README file should contain information about the analyzer that will assist the end user on how to use and augment the analyzer.

Here is an example start of a block analyzer README file:
